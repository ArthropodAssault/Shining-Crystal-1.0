__**Shining Crystal 1.0 Changelog**__

All boss teams are updated, often with more challenging pokemon with stronger movesets.

There are modifications to the trainer and wild level curves. These are especially prominent in the postgame.

Opponent status moves no longer have a 25% accuracy debuff.

Many bosses have buffed DVs.

Badge boosts, including attack type and stat boosts, are removed from the game.

More opponent pokemon now hold items.

TMs are reusable.

Certain TMs previously only available in the post-game are now accessible earlier.

There are new TMs added.

HMs are deleteable.

Almost all wild enocunter tables are updated.

Some pokemon have increased catch rates. This makes them more suitable as early game encounters for nuzlockers.

Fewer pokemon flee and pokemon with roar or whirlwind in their level up learnset have it removed. The roaming legendaries still always flee unless trapped.

Some previously unavailable pokemon are now catcheable. All legendaries including the Kanto birds, mew, and mewtwo are catcheable before the pokemon league.

Some gift and trade pokemon are replaced with new pokemon.

Eggs hatch with fewer steps.

Friendship accrues quicker.

The three starters are changed.

Many pokemon have learnset upgrades.

Trade evolutions now evolve by evolution stone.

The evolution stones are now purchaseable in certain marts. There are some other changes to mart items.

Rare candies are purchaseable at every mart for 1 pokedollar. There are a few other quality of life features incorportated that I would prefer not to spoil.

Select moves are buffed.

A few pokemon have their base stats buffed. For example - feraligatr and arcanine's special attack and attack stats are reversed compared to the vanilla games. Ie - feraligatr now has 105 special attack and 79 attack.

DVs are no longer associated with gender. Hidden power type is still based on DVs.

The clock change procedure is simplified. From the title screen you press Down + B + Select to reset the clock.

No new pokemon or fakemon are added.

There are no changes to the map.

The physical-special split, abilities, and natures are not in this game.

This game is incompatible with PKHex.

All of the code is searcheable on Github. This allows you to see all the updates to the game including changes to moves, learnsets, base stats, etc. You must be signed in to a Github account to search code. Here is a search tip: in the code repository, two words will often be separated by an underscore. Ie: "Sunny Day" in the game is written as "sunny_day" in the repository.

I've designed this game for hardcore nuzlocking. Certain game components such as level caps, route encounters, and rare candy availability are built specifically with that in mind. This need not detract from non-nuzlocke gameplay.
