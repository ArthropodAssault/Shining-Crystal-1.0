Rare candies are purchaseable at every mart for 1 pokedollar. There are a few other quality of life features incorportated that I would prefer not to spoil. This game is incompatible with PKHex. 

All of the code is searcheable on Github. This allows you to see all the updates to the game. You must be signed in to a Github account to search code. In the code repository, two words will often be separated by an underscore. Ie: "Sunny Day" in the game is written as "sunny_day" in the repository.

I've designed this game for hardcore nuzlocking. Certain game components, such as level caps, route encounters, and rare candy availability are built specifically with that in mind. This should not detract from non-nuzlocke gameplay.
